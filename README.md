# Websites
Learning how to build a website using Khan Academy. 
All the practices with notes will be uploaded. 
With Khan Academy, I hope to build my own website(s), starting with a portfolio. 
I will be using Notepad++ on my laptop and locally storing them so that I may test and see the output of the code.
